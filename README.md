# TempGBA4PSP-mod-sharp-bilinear

Based on TempGBA4PSP-mod by phoe-nix [https://github.com/phoe-nix/TempGBA4PSP-mod]

Implementing a sharp bilinear filter, based on TheMaister's work.

The idea is to apply a fixed 2x integer prescale resulting in a small amount of image blurring but no pixelwobble.

Bilinear filter can be toggled on or off.
